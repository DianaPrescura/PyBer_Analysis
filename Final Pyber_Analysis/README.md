# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019

The purpose of the analysis is to oulie the differences by city type and how to determine how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 
The analysis has been created with the help of Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib which facilitated a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. In other words, it helps determine which city type is cheaper and which is more expensive.

Results

In the first part of the analysis:

* The urban cities have the record as far as the total rides, number of drivers and implicit the total fares. There were registered 1625 total rides in the urban areas, opposed to only 125 rides in the rural;
* Only 78 drivers that registered a number of 4327.93$ in total fares were identified in the rural cities compared to the urban cities where total fares were 39854.38$, fares cashed by 2405 drivers.  
* Suburban drivers in total of 490, are paired with 19356.33$ in total fares;
* Despite being less drivers in the rural cities, there was identified the highest average fare per ride: 34.64$, surpassing its rival categories 30.97$ for the suburban and 24.52$ fot the urban cities.

The second part of PyBer Analysis has as target the delivery of a multiple chart of total fares for each city type, as seen below:

As a result, we obtain information regarding the fare fluctuations by city between January to April 2019. At the end of February all the cities had an increase in fares; however, urban cities had more overall fluctuations in March. Moreover, the highest total rural fare was $500 in April 2019. Lastly, suburban cities had a spike at the end of April compared to urban and rural cities.

Summary
* It is recommended to extend the analysis to other periods of time, as the data provided was registered form January until May. 
* Another analysis it could be done, regarding the distannce and the duration of the rides. This could give us as insight to whether is there a correlation between the time a driver requiers for his ride and the profitability.
* Focusing on the profitability, this time by reducing the number of drivers in the urban cities shoulld be taking in consideration as well.
